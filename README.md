Nginx-Lua-Anti-DDoS
A Anti-DDoS script to protect Nginx web servers using Lua with a Javascript based authentication puzzle inspired by Cloudflare I am under attack mode I built my own Anti-DDoS authentication HTML page puzzle intergrating my Lua, Javascript, HTML and HTTP knowledge.

Mitigate a DDoS attack of any size using my free DDoS protection. Don't get ddos attacked!

If you're under attack and use my script during the attack, visitors will receive an interstitial page for about five seconds while I analyze the traffic to make sure it is a legitimate human visitor.

This can protect you from many different forms of DDoS works with both HTTP and HTTPS / SSL traffic.

No limit on attack size Uptime guarantee
